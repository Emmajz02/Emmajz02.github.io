        "To Love a Canine Rescue, Inc. (TLC) is a non-profit, all breed, foster based, dog rescue based in Chester County, PA. Our mission is to find permanent homes for abandoned, stray and surrendered dogs in order to minimize the needless euthanizing of animals. Our dogs come to us from “put to sleep” lists at local and southern shelters, as well as from owner surrenders. We focus on making the right connections between our dogs and families in order to give the dogs the loving and permanent home they deserve.   Our Mini Paws junior volunteer program is designed to train children, 4-18, in proper animal care and instill a love of community service, and a community outreach program to provide education on responsible pet ownership, including the importance of spaying/neutering, behavior training, and microchip implanting."
